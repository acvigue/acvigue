### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a high school senior who's interested in computer science with a focus on projects related to embedded engineering.

I'm currently working on emulating my HID iCLASS door key by using a generic Java Card applet running on my smart ring.

Some of my recent projects include:

- Swiftfin - Available on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/swiftfin/id1604098728) ([source](https://github.com/jellyfin/swiftfin)), a iOS/tvOS frontend for the Jellyfin project that uses modern technologies including VLCKit and SwiftUI
- SmartMatrix ([server](https://github.com/acvigue/SmartMatrixServer)/[client](https://github.com/acvigue/SmartMatrix-ESP32)), a self-hosted smart display that displays important information in a timely manner ( C++ w/ a Javascript backend )
- Kinetic Sand Table ([firmware](https://github.com/acvigue/RBotFirmware)/[web ui](https://github.com/acvigue/sandspa3)), a robotic sand table that magically draws patterns using a magnet. ( C++ w/ a Vue frontend )
- VolvoCarPlay ([firmware](https://github.com/acvigue/VolvoCarPlay-SAMD)/[canbus](https://github.com/acvigue/VolvoCarPlay-CANBus)/[android](https://github.com/acvigue/VolvoCarPlay-APK)), a custom Android-based head unit with a LVDS switching circuit that integrates with factory stereo and steering wheel controls in a Volvo XC70 ( C++ w/ an Android app )
- Membox - check it out [here](https://app.membox.cc) ([firmware](https://github.com/acvigue/membox-esp32)/[web ui](https://github.com/acvigue/membox-react)), a scalable IoT project that consists of an electronic "memory box" that displays sent pictures and animations from a smartphone app (C++ w/ a Vue frontend)
